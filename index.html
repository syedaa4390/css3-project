    <p id="yahia-comment"><strong>@mimi-yahia</strong> Oh ya-ya he was my teacher! He taught me how to be peppermint and he gives great encourage-mint! This movie is an easy 5 out of 5!</p>

    <p style="clear: left"><strong>@idk</strong> I was grateful for the theatre chairs. I thought I was going to faint! I’m going to give this movie a-</p>

    <p><strong>@mueller-productions</strong> Thank you <strong>@idk</strong>! Don’t worry, we will provide aspirin in theatres so that you won't collapse from the comedy acts! When you wake up from unconsciousness, please give us a good rating!</p>

    <p><strong>@peppermint2.0</strong> He’s from Colorado, but he didn’t have to leave us in a STATE of shock. I didn't expect those puns to take the COLOR-ADO my face. Being an old math teacher, he should subtract those puns because I can’t EVEN anymore.
      1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11… I’ll wait until I can use an even number to give a rating.</p>

    <p><i>Note: These critics had VIP passes for a movie screening.</i></p><br>
